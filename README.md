### This is a data analysis project that I did in order to figure out the popularity of various programming languages like C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript etc from the year 2008 till 2020 based on the data set obtained from the tags assigned to the programming problems posted on stackoverflow from the year 2008 till 2020 (check out the QueryResults.csv file obtained from the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

### Here I am leveraging the Matplotlib library to analyze the time series data in order to figure out the trends in the popularity among various programming languages from 2008 till 2020.
